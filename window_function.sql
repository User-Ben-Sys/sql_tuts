-- âœ… This query checks whether (salary_year_avg, salary_hour_avg) is greater than (100000, 50) using row comparison.
-- âœ… It returns a TRUE or FALSE value for each row.

/* ðŸ”¹ How This Works
1. ROW (salary_year_avg, salary_hour_avg) creates a tuple (row).
2. ROW (100000, 50) is another tuple used for comparison.
3. The > operator compares tuples element-wise:
4. First, salary_year_avg is compared to 100000.
5. If equal, salary_hour_avg is compared to 50.
----------------------------------------
âœ” ROW() is used for tuple (multi-column) comparisons.
âœ” SQL compares tuple values element-by-element (like sorting logic).
âœ” Can simplify WHERE conditions that compare multiple values.
